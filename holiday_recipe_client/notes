//state is muttable and can be modified
//state can only be used state and class components

//Function component : A functional component returns JSX, 
//instead of using a render method. 
//they still can recieve props but they have to be 
//:explicitly written as an argument for the function
// function component is also a presentational compnent/
//as the dont need contain custom methods, 
//relying mainly on props.

//HOOKS:
// Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions 
//based on what pieces are related 
//(such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), 
//rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.
