REDUX DATA FLOW 
1.)an action is dispatch when user interacts with the application
2.)the root reducer is called with the current state and the dispatch action, 
then it may divide task  to smaller reducer  and return the new state
3.)the store notifies the view by excuting the callback
4.)The view then retrieves the updated state and re render it again

Thunk allows us to return a function inside of our 
// our action creator returns a plain JavaScript object,
//receives the store's dispatch function as its argument,
//we can dispatch multiple actions from inside that returned function.
//thunk give me access to my dispatch because of the action creator
